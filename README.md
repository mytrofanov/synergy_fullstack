To deploy project:

2. go to the BACKEND_DIRECTORY 
use command: cd backend
3. Start file Docker-file with command:
docker-compose up
4.open link in browser:  http://localhost:3000/

If using Windows you should use WSL2 as Docker Engine and need to install Ubuntu becouse driver 'bridge' in docker-compose.yml works only on Linux based system
